# Vigenere Cipher Decryption
Created for Computer Security Project 1, this program will take a vigenere cipher output and attempt to piece together the key used to encrypt the file that can then be used to decrypt the file (Does not decrypt the file)

## How to use

To use the program, you must first compile it using `make` in the terminal.

```
C:/Vigenere-Cipher-Decryption-master> make
```

From there, the file will be exported as `output.exe` (or just `output` if you're on Linux, assuming it compiles, I think it should)

After getting the .exe file, enter this command to run the program
```
C:/Vigenere-Cipher-Decryption-master> ./output <name-of-file> [characters in vigenere cipher]
```

The program should return the potential key to the vigenere cipher

## Assumptions
1. The first argument given is a vigenere cipher encrypted txt file
2. There is a positive non-zero value for the number of letters in the key (Defaults to one if no value is given, or the given value is less than 1)
